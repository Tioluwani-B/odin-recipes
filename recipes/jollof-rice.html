<h3> Steps</h3>
<hr>

<p> Here are the steps to prepare Nigerian Jollof Rice:</p>
<ol>
<l1>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they become translucent.</l1>
<l1>Add the minced garlic, chopped red bell pepper, and Scotch bonnet pepper to the pot. Sauté for a few minutes until the peppers soften.</l1>
<l1>Stir in the tomato paste and cook for a couple of minutes to enhance the flavor.</l1>
<l1>Add the blended or pureed tomatoes to the pot and cook the mixture for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and the oil separates from the tomatoes.</l1>
<l1>If using meat or shrimp, add them to the pot and cook until they are partially cooked and coated with the tomato sauce.</l1>
<l1>Rinse the rice thoroughly and add it to the pot. Stir well to ensure that the rice is well-coated with the sauce.</l1>
<l1>Pour in the stock or water, ensuring that there is enough liquid to cover the rice. Add the curry powder, thyme, bay leaves, and crumbled seasoning cubes (if using).</l1>
<l1>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. Allow the rice to simmer for about 20-25 minutes or until it is fully cooked and the liquid has been absorbed.</l1>
<l1>Check the seasoning and add salt as needed. Gently fluff the rice with a fork.</l1>
<l1>Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit, covered, for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</l1>
<l1>Serve the Nigerian African Jollof hot, garnished with fresh parsley or coriander if desired.</l1>


<p>Remember to adjust the spice levels and ingredient quantities according to your taste preferences. Enjoy your homemade Nigerian African Jollof!</p>
